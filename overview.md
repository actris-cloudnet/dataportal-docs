# Overview

Cloudnet is a data pipeline to process and distribute cloud remote sensing
data from measurement sites all over the Globe. Cloudnet consists of a 
[processing code](https://github.com/actris-cloudnet/cloudnetpy), 
[data portal](https://cloudnet.fmi.fi), and various [APIs](apis.md) 
to submit raw data and access processed data products.

Cloudnet is also one key element of [ACTRIS](https://www.actris.eu/). ACTRIS Data Centre node 
for cloud profiling (CLU) utilizes Cloudnet ecosystem to serve official ACTRIS cloud 
remote sensing products through the [ACTRIS data portal](https://actris.nilu.no/).

While the [Cloudnet data portal](https://cloudnet.fmi.fi) contains more data than
the official ACTRIS data portal, it provides only partially quality 
controlled data, non-standard metadata schema, experimental products, and so on.
