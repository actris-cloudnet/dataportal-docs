The SIRTA Atmospheric Research Observatory is one of few sites in Europe offering the instrumentation
and the facilities to study atmospheric physico-chemical processes from the surface to the upper
troposphere through the boundary layer. At SIRTA, we study climate variability at regional and
decadal scales and evaluate the performance of atmospheric models (climate projection, weather
forecast, chemistry-transport, etc.).

SIRTA addresses the needs of four missions that span on multi-decadal time scales:

- Atmospheric Monitoring: SIRTA carries out and provides access to long time series of
  atmospheric observations necessary to improve our knowledge of atmospheric physico-chemical
  processes (gases, aerosols, clouds, precipitation, thermodynamics, dynamics, radiation),
  to study climate variability on decadal and regional scales, and to evaluate atmospheric models.

- Atmospheric Exploration: SIRTA hosts experimental measurement campaigns in a rich
  observational environment, equipped with efficient logistics. It allows us to explore
  complex atmospheric processes, to develop methods exploiting instrumental synergies
  (tracers, in-situ series and remote sensing), to prepare future satellite observations
  and validate on-going ones, to develop new parameterizations for models, to test and qualify new instruments.

- Experimental teaching: SIRTA allows the realization of experimental work and teaching
  projects that take place as part of atmospheric science courses (hosting of students at
  Bachelor, Master and Doctorate levels).

- Metrological and radiative expertise: SIRTA hosts two expertise centers of the
  ACTRIS research infrastructure which aim at
  improving the quality of measurements, methods and data of networks of observations of
  physical properties of clouds ([CCRES](https://ccres.aeris-data.fr/en/about_ccres/welcome/)) and the
  physico-chemical properties of aerosols ([ACMCC](https://acmcc.aeris-data.fr/)).
  SIRTA also hosts and maintains a surface radiation budget station that contribute
  to the Baseline Surface Radiation Network ([BSRN](https://bsrn.awi.de/)).

The scientific perimeter of activities carried out at SIRTA includes reactive and
greenhouse gases, aerosols, clouds, and precipitation, radiative exchanges, heat fluxes,
atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics. The scientific applications also concern the
use of these fields of expertise to study their impact on human activities such as health,
transport and energy (with a particular focus on solar and wind renewable energies).
