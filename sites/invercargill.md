# Invercargill

At the station in Invercargill the Leipzig Aerosol and Cloud Remote
Observations System (LACROS) of Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research
(TROPOS) is being deployed from about September 2025 to March 2027. LACROS
comprises a full set of remote-sensing instruments for ACTRIS ARS (Aerosol
Remote Sensing) and CRS (Cloud Remote Sensing), including 35- and 94&nbsp;GHz
cloud radars, a scanning Doppler lidar, two ceilometers (one with polarization
capabilities) and a Sun/Moon photometer. Unique for LACROS is the operation of
a [PollyXT](https://polly.tropos.de) multiwavelength-polarization-Raman lidar.
For the deployment to Invercargill, this lidar system was in addition extended
by a detection channel for fluorescence scattering which enables to distinguish
fluorescent smoke and other organic aerosols from inorganic ones like volcanic
sulfates.

Besides the set of instruments that provide data to the Cloudnet data portal,
the station is additionally equipped with the following remote-sensing and
in-situ instrumentation:

- BSRN-compatible surface radiation station equipped with instruments for
  spectrally resolved and broadband incoming and outgoing solar and terrestrial
  radiation
- 2-dimensional disdrometer (2DVD)
- Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) for aerosol in the size range from
  5&nbsp;nm to 32&nbsp;µm
- Cloud Condensation Nuclei counter (CCNC)
- Low-Volume-Sampler (LVS) for collection of 12-hourly aerosol samples for
  ice-nucleating particle analysis

The deployment of LACROS to Invercargill is done in the framework of the
[goSouth-2 campaign](https://gosouth2.tropos.de). goSouth-2 has the goal to
explore which contrasts in the properties of clouds can be discovered when
clean and polluted air masses alternately arrive at Invercargill. Thereby, the
clean air masses arriving to the site usually travelled several days over the
Southern Ocean, while air masses originating from Australia tend to be burden
with desert dust aerosol or biomass-burning smoke.

goSouth-2 is accompanying the aircraft campaign
[HALO-South](https://halo-research.de/sience/halo-missions/current-missions/halo-south/)
of the High-Altitude and LOng-range research aircraft (HALO) of the German
Aerospace Centre, which provides in-situ data of aerosols and clouds from
around New Zealand for the time frame from 6 September to 11 October 2025.
