# Troll Station

Troll research station in Jutulsessen in Antarctica is the base and starting
point for biological, glaciological and geological field work during the summer
season, and is a full-year base for continuous, long-term monitoring series in
meteorology, radiation, atmosphere, upper atmosphere, environmental toxins and
seismology.

Troll is located around 235&nbsp;km from the coast in Dronning Maud Land, a
central area for Norwegian research in Antarctica. It is unusually located on
the slope between the coast and the interior plateau.

The station is manned year round. It can accommodate six people in the
Antarctic winter and many more in summer.

Intensive cloud monitoring at the station started in the southern summer
2024â€“25. Other atmospheric monitoring goes back many years.
