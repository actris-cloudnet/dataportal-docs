# Leipzig LIM

The Leipzig Institute for Meteorology (LIM) is located close to the
city centre of Leipzig on the edge of a garden area. When the
remote sensing instruments are not being used for field experiments,
they are located on the roof platform of the new institute building
at a height of 126 meters above sea level. Cloud remote sensing
observations began in 2020.
