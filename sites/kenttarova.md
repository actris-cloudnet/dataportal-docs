# Kenttärova

Kenttärova is a remote site in Northern Finland. It's a part of the [Pallas
Atmosphere-Ecosystem Supersite](https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/pallas-atmosphere-ecosystem-supersite)
hosted by the Finnish Meteorological Institute. The station was established in
2002 and features a 20-meter-high measurement tower for studying
atmosphere–biosphere interactions above a spruce forest (Lohila et al. 2015).
Cloud remote sensing measurements in Kenttärova were first conducted as part of
the Pallas Cloud Experiment (PaCE) campaigns in 2015, 2017 and 2019 (Tukiainen
et al. 2025). Continuous cloud remote sensing at the site started in 2022.
