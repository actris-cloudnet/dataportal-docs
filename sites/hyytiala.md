# Hyytiälä

Hyytiälä is a historical forestry station in Finland, operated by the
University of Helsinki. Hyytiälä hosts the [Station for Measuring
Ecosystem–Atmosphere Relations II](https://www.atm.helsinki.fi/smear/smear-ii/)
(SMEAR II), one of the world’s most comprehensive surface in situ observation
sites in a boreal forest environment. The instrumentation covers aerosol
dynamics, atmospheric chemistry, micrometeorology, weather monitoring, cloud
remote sensing and ecophysiology of trees growing in the urban environment.

The cloud remote observations in Hyytiälä have started in 2012. These
observations were carried out on campaign basis. In 2014, the second [ARM
Mobile Facility](https://www.arm.gov/capabilities/observatories/amf) (AMF2) was
deployed to Hyytiälä, as a part of Biogenic Aerosols–Effects on Clouds and
Climate experiment (Petäjä et al., 2016). Since then, continuous observations
of cloud and precipitation are carried out at the site.

The cloud profiling site is located on the lake Kuivajärvi shore. It is about
30 m below the base of the SMEAR II mast, where most aerosol measurments are
performed.
