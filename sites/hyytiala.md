# Hyytiälä

Hyytiälä is a historical forestry station in Finland, operated by the
University of Helsinki. Hyytiälä hosts the [Station for Measuring
Ecosystem–Atmosphere Relations II](https://www.atm.helsinki.fi/smear/smear-ii/)
(SMEAR&nbsp;II), one of the world’s most comprehensive surface in situ
observation sites in a boreal forest environment. The instrumentation covers
aerosol dynamics, atmospheric chemistry, micrometeorology, weather monitoring,
cloud remote sensing and ecophysiology of trees growing in the urban
environment.

The cloud remote observations in Hyytiälä started in 2012 on a campaign basis.
In 2014, the second [ARM Mobile Facility](https://www.arm.gov/capabilities/observatories/amf)
(AMF2) was deployed to Hyytiälä, as a part of Biogenic Aerosols–Effects on
Clouds and Climate experiment (Petäjä et al., 2016). Since then, continuous
observations of cloud and precipitation are carried out at the site.

The cloud profiling site is located on the lake Kuivajärvi shore. It is about
30&nbsp;m below the base of the SMEAR&nbsp;II mast, where most aerosol
measurements are performed.
