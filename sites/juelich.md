# Jülich

The Jülich Observatory for Cloud Evolution (JOYCE) provides temporally highly
resolved measurements to improve our understanding of the emergence,
development and decay of clouds. The observational platform at the Research
Centre Jülich is located in an urbanized setting surrounded by forest, within
rural lowlands amidst two large open lignite mines and agricultural areas.

The facility has been performing continuous ground-based remote sensing
observations since 2011. State-of-the-art active and passive remote sensing
instruments are used to analyse cloud and precipitation processes as well as
the atmospheric boundary layer vertical structure. Temperature and humidity
profiling measurements are carried out, as well measurements for obtaining
horizontal and vertical winds including turbulence. In addition, detailed
micro- and macrophysical properties of clouds are derived.

The scientific objectives of JOYCE are to develop and test new methodologies
for quantifying clouds and precipitation, perform model and satellite
evaluation and to better understand the cloud life cycle within an environment
with multiple, complex influences. The extensive long-term data set allows to
characterize diurnal and seasonal patterns in a statistical way.
