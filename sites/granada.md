# Granada

UGR station is located in the city of Granada, a medium-sized
non-industrialised city (>&nbsp;500k inhabitants, including metropolitan area)
surrounded by high mountains (1000 to 3398&nbsp;m&nbsp;asl), and 50&nbsp;km
from the Mediterranean coast. It presents large seasonal temperature
differences, low relative humidity, scarce precipitation and light winds
influenced by local mountain–valley flow. The station combines long-term
monitoring of the vertical distribution of atmospheric aerosol with in-situ
measurements for aerosol particle characterisation, as well as cloud, solar and
atmospheric radiation monitoring at different spectral ranges. It is part of
the Andalusian Global ObseRvatory of the Atmosphere (AGORA), consisting of
several sites allowing the coverage of different atmospheric backgrounds and
contributing to three ACTRIS components.

Remote cloud observations in Granada have been continuously performed since
2019, when the station’s first Doppler cloud radar was installed. Since 2024
the station is also equipped with a dual-frequency Doppler cloud radar with
scanning capabilities that continuously feeds data to Cloudnet. These systems
complemented the microwave radiometer and ceilometer measurements initiated in
previous years, together with additional instrumentation (e.g. Doppler lidar,
meterological station, disdrometer).
