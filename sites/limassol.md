# Limassol

The ERATOSTHENES Centre of Excellence in Limassol, Cyprus is the host
institution of the Cyprus Atmospheric Remote Sensing Observatory (CARO)
National Facility (NF) designed for continuous monitoring of aerosols and
clouds, providing crucial observations and a reference station for
calibration/validation of satellite missions.

The CAROâ€™s ground-based atmospheric remote sensing station consolidates
advanced infrastructure and high-quality instrumentation for aerosol and cloud
remote sensing. Located in the heart of Limassol, approximately 800 meters from
the coastline, the station captures unique atmospheric data influenced by urban
and coastal dynamics.
